# Cheatsheets, Keymaps, and Recipes

There are many contexts where we need to do something equivalent to running a command or performing some operation with the keyboard. We can broadly categorize these contexts like below:

| Context                        | Description |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| interactive shell command      | x           |
| interactive fzf command        | x           |
| tmux commands                  | x           |
| tmux f-keys                    | x           |
| tmux option keybindings        | x           |
